# explorableExplanations

A workshop by [@somehats](https://github.com/SomeHats) and [@matteomenapace](https://github.com/matteomenapace).

Based on [explorableexplanations.com](http://explorableexplanations.com/) by [@ncase](https://github.com/ncase).

### Provisional plan

- [ ] What are EE?
- [ ] Working in pairs, analyse an EE and then present it to everyone else.
- [ ] *Systems*: whole vs parts, interactions and interdependencies, feedback loops.
- [ ] What type of themes lend themselves to EE? Good and bad examples.
- [ ] Working in small teams, jot down a few **ideas** for EE: these can be *issues* you care about, or *things* you'd like to explain to others through EE. If you're stuck, we'll have some ideas for you.
- [ ] **Paper-prototype** your ideas!
- [ ] We will share open-source code for EE that you can **remix**.

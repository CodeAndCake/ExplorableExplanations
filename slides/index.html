                In groups of 2-ish, play through one of these examples. Think about how it compares to other
                stuff. Why does this format work? Who is this example aimed at? etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                If possible, look at two of the examples - one from each side of the list. They're
                pretty different. Compare the two examples you looked at
              </p>
              <p>
                Briefly present your comparison back to the group.

          <h3>Broadly, the examples answer one of two questions:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>How does this system work/how do I build this system myself?</li>
            <li>How does [some complicated thing] behave, as demonstrated by this system?</li>
          </ol>

            <p>
              So, it seems the examples split fairly nicely into two groups. The things on the left
              list demonstrate systems, and show you how those systems work and how you can use them
              yourself. The examples on the right are exploring much more complicated ideas, and
              using a system to model some aspect of them. The system is a metaphor, and by playing
              with it you can form some sort of intuition of how things work outside of it.

            <aside class="notes">
              Systems! A system is a set of interconnected things. The things
              interact or depend on each other in a certain way, and more complex behavior emerges
              from interactions between the simple components.

              For example, this crudely drawn wheel has a simple set of behaviours - it can roll
              forwards or backwards. If you combine it with a bunch of other crudely drawn things...

              ...you can get a much more complex (yet still terribly drawn) system. The whole is
              greater than the sum of its parts. In this example, *different* compoments compose
              into the more complex system.

            <aside class="notes">
              In an agent-based model, you simulate the interactions of many autonomous agents. The
              agents are following simple rules, but by observing them togther, you can see much
              more complex behavior on the system as a whole.

              Each shape moves randomly, according to the rules. Whilst each individual action
              doesn't show much of interest, overall we quickly see the implications on the wider system.
